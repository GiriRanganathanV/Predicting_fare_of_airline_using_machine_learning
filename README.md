# Predicting_fare_of_airline_using_machine_learning
Predicting the fare of airline tickets using multiple machine learning models

# Objective:
The objective of the project is to build and compare different machine learning models to predict the cancellation of a hotel booking. 

# Data overview: 
The data set consists of 11 attributes and 10683 observations. The dataset needs preprocessing since it consists of missing values and also outlier treatment is required to handle the outliers before building the models.

# Workflow:
Data preprocessing and data type conversion to timestamp  
Handling categorical data using LabelEncoder & OneHotEncoder  
Treating the outliers and feature selection  
Spitting train and test data set and cross validation using Linear regression   
Implementing multiple machine learning models and predicting the accuracy  

# Machine learning models build:
 Linear regression  
 KNN  
 Decision tree  
 RandomForest
